**The Cost of Ignoring Competitive Depth — Next Move Strategy Consulting Analyzes the Top 15 Players**

In the world of industrial automation, "knowing your enemy" is half the battle.

Most research firms take the lazy route. They profile the top 3 giants (like Siemens or ABB), copy-paste their "About Us" page, and call it a "Competitive Landscape."

**The Pain Point**: The threat to your business usually doesn't come from the giant you know—it comes from the agile competitor you ignored.

**The Solution**: I reviewed the DCS Market report by Next Move Strategy Consulting, and their approach to competition is completely different.

•	Top 15, Not Top 3: They analyze the strategies of the top 15 players, exposing the full battlefield.

•	Real Strategy, Not Just Logos: They look at mergers, acquisitions, and R&D shifts. They tell you what the competition is doing, not just who they are.
